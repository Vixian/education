#Windows Forms projects

**Matching Game** (Q1 2013)

A game I recreated by following a tutorial for Windows Forms. It’s a simple puzzle game just to demonstrate functionality.

**Maze Game** (Q1 2013)

An original application I created from scratch. It is a maze solving game, featuring both keyboard and mouse mode. I also implemented random maze generation algorithm to add replayability. The interface is borderless, minimalistic, but isn’t that the best kind?

I also included a binary inside the `Maze/Maze` folder if you’d like to try it out. It requires VS 2013 Redistributable and also runs under Wine on Linux with a minor positioning bug.

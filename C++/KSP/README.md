#KSP Assignments

**20121st**: The goal is to find out whether two arrays of numbers were just a reordering of one another or if they were different.

**20122nd**: The goal is to find out the minimum distance your hand has to travel on a keyboard to play all the notes on a keyboard. The paramaters are N - the number of notes, L - the width of the hand, R - the position of the hand.

**20124th**: The goal is to implement a game of turtles, where the turtles move around a board and can stack upon each other and when one turtle moves, all the turtles above it move as well.

*Note: With each of these assignments there is a .pdf document that contains my description of the implementation as required by competition for submission.*

**Life Insurance**: Unfortunatelly, I can no longer find or access the original assignment specification.

**Snowflake**: This one should print a  snowflake.

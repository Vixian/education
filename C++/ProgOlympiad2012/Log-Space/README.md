###Assignments

Implement the following assignments by using algorithms, with memory complexity `log(N)` or smaller. The time complexity doesnâ€™t matter.

####Part 1

Sort an array that may contain elements with repetitions.

####Part 2

The input are two arrays A and B, find out whether these arrays are different, or simply a reordering of one another.

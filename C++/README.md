#C++ Projects

All the C++ projects and little scripts I have programmed over the years. Some of the files here are quite old.

**BinaryTree**: A little script that prints out a binary tree to the console in a nice, spaced form. I forgot how to set the arguments for a larger tree.

**Brackets**: A program that checks bracket completeness of the input string. The first argument it expects is the number of strings you are going to input. Then the strings themselves. Supported brackets: {},(),[]

**CodeChef**: A few easy problems I solved for the [CodeChef](http://www.codechef.com/) online judge when checking it out.

**Combinations**: A program that prints out and counts all the possible Combinations of N numbers. Use a small number. It scales very fast.

**Crypto**: An encryption and decryption program that encrypts a text file by inverting all the bits byte by byte, then reverses the process on decryption.

**DisplayImage**: An image viewer I wrote when I was playing with the OpenCV library.

**FullScreenConsole**: Long time ago I had the problem of being unable to make my console window go fullscreen on Windows. I wrote a script that implemented this. I am not sure if it works anymore.

**KSP**: A few algorithmic problems I solved for a high school programming competition, that serves as a preparation for the programming olympiad.

**Primes**: A bruteforce implementation of a prime generation algorithm. I programmed it as a benchmarking tool.

**ProgConfAlgo**: A few algorithmic problems I solved at a three day joint math/physics/programming event that served as a preparation for the programming olympiad.

**ProgOlympiad2013**: This folder contains the problems I solved for the 2013 Programming Olympiad in which I managed to ascend to the national round.

**SDL**: A few small applications I created when testing out the SDL library. I never got to making a full fledged game.

**SKDict**: A little script I wrote because I had the problem of finding a Slovak language dictionary for bruteforcing without accents. I found one that was accented, cleaned it and created both a lowercase and a non case sensitive version.

**Tic-Tac-Toe**: The first program I wrote in C++. It is the direct port of the Tic-Tac-Toe I wrote in Pascal as an attempt to become language independent. It should still work.

**VideoPlayer**: A simple video player application that reads from an online stream, but can also read from a file. It uses the OpenCV library.

**somnerBlink**: A simulation of an [EVE Online lottery](https://cogdev.net/blink/) I wrote because I was trying to maximize my winnings. The simulation concluded that the lottery is set so the house always wins. :)

#IJC Project 2

**DISCLAIMER**: Code files inside this project are uncommented, therefore they may have limited readability.

###Assignment

####Part 1 a)

Reimplement the unix utility `tail` to support multiple input files, input from the stdin and the -n flag. Examples:

```
tail file
tail -n 20 file1 file2
tail -n +3
```

*Note: the program works with a limited length buffer while supporting arbitrary length line widths.*

####Part 1 b)

**TODO**

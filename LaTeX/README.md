#LaTeX projects

*Note: All the projects inside this file are in Slovak.*

School projects I completed in LaTeX.

###ITO

Circuit theory homework submitted in LaTeX for extra points.

###IUS

C program documentation written in LaTeX. The program the documentation is intended for can be found at [C/IZPProject2](https://github.com/Vixian/education/tree/master/C/IZPProject2).

###ITY

Projects from a LaTeX subject at my university.

Each assignment targets a different set of features of the LaTeX language.

The goal of each assignment is to recreate a LaTeX generated `project<number>Template.pdf` document as closely as possible.

Each folder contains the template, my generated `.pdf` file, the required `.tex` files and a Makefile.

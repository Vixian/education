#Machine Learning class by Andrew Ng

This folder include all of the assignments I completed while following the incredible [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) by Andrew Ng on Coursera. I recommend it to everybody.

Every folder includes a .pdf file detailing the assignment and file structure. The files markde with a `*` are the ones I had to fill in. To be fair, there was a lot of skeleton code ready for me.

The assignments are still executable in their working form by using octave and running the `ex<number>` file, or additional files as detailed in  the .pdf files.

**Topics covered**: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Principal component analysis, Dimensionality reduction, SVM, Neural networks, Clustering, Anomaly detection, Recommender Systems, Scaling and optimalization of Machine Learning systems

**Date**: Q4 2014

**Date**: Q4 2010

Two (not broken) little programs I wrote back when I was 14, in Pascal, the first language I learned. I also had a Tic-Tac-Toe program which I later rewrote in C++ (you can find it in `C++/Tic-Tac-Toe`). But it appears to be broken.

###Description###

**Palindro.pas**: Outputs, whether the entered string is a palindrome or not. The first argument it expects is a number of string you are going to enter.

**Priklady.pas**: A calculator program supporting \*, /, +, -. It expects the number of numbers as a first argument. Then you can enter, separated by Enter, the numbers intertwined by operators.

Anything and everything I have coded and felt like sharing.

**DISCLAIMER**: Many of the code files inside this repository are old, uncommented and weren’t ment for outside evaluation. Please take that into consideration.

*Note: The language percentages are off because Python has a lot of skeleton code I didn’t write.*
